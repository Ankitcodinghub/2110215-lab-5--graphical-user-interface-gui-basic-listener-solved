Instruction

1. Click the provided link on CourseVille to create your own repository.

2. Open Eclipse and then ‚ÄúFile &gt; new &gt; Java Project‚Äù and set project name in this format

2110215_Lab5_2021_1_{ID}_{FIRSTNAME}

‚óã Example: 2110215_Lab5_2021_1_6337492021_Jirapash.

3. Initialize git in your project directory ‚óã Add .gitignore.

‚óã Commit and push initial codes to your GitHub repository.

4. Implement all the classes and methods following the details given in the problem statement file which you can download from CourseVille.

‚óã The provided files contain two folders: src and res. make sure to add both into your project. (And use both of them as Source Folder)

‚óã You should create commits with meaningful messages when you finish each part of your program.

‚óã You don‚Äôt need to wait until you finish all features to create a commit.

5. Export your project into a jar file called Lab5_2021_1_{ID} and place it at the root directory of your project.

‚óã Example: Lab5_2021_1_6337492021.jar

6. Push all other commits to your GitHub repository

1. Problem Statement: Harvest Simulator

With the economic crisis, CPShop had to be closed. With a little of money left, the manager of the shop chooses to return to his hometown in a countryside and back to the good old way of life of his parents ‚Äî agriculture. He knows you who is a programmer and he want to run a simulation on income gain from harvest crops he planted. Also, he takes very good care of his crops so they never wither.

Harvest Simulator

This is a simulation program for calculating income from each harvest. The manager has some programming knowledge so the program is partially done. He asks you to complete it for him. You need to understand JAVAFX and EVENT-HANDLER in order to complete this assignment.

Figure 1: The initial GUI of the application

The GUI can be divided into TWO parts Control part on the left and Field part on the

right.

Control part

This is a part to select an item, be it a seed or the removal tool, show current money and button for simulating each harvest. For a seed, it is used to plant in the field. For the removal tool, it is used to remove a plant in the field.

Figure 2: The GUI of the Control part

The selected item will be highlighted if clicked when you have enough money for it. If you choose another item that you can afford, the newly clicked item will be highlighted instead.

NO MORE THAN ONE ITEM WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED AT THE SAME TIME.

After planting a crop, if money reduced from buying a seed is less than selected item price, the item will be unselected and unhighlighted. If you hover mouse over an item button, the tooltip of that item will be shown for item information

Figure 3: The GUI of the Control part when selected an item and hovering mouse over an item Field part

This part represents the field with space to plant crops. When clicking a field cell while selecting an item, an action will be done according to item selected.

Figure 4: The GUI of the Field part

JavaFX Install and Project Setup (If you have not done so). Please set the command line argument correctly (shown next page!)

In this assignment, you need to use JavaFX version 11 -15 in order to run the project and do this assignment.

If you don‚Äôt have any JavaFX, you can get the latest version from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/

Please download the latest release SDK of your OS version.

Once the download complete, extract the file then move the extracted folder to somewhere that you think it is easily accessible.

The recommended location is ‚ÄúC:Program FilesJava‚Äù

To add JavaFX to the eclipse project, follow these steps.

1. Right-Click your project &gt; Build Path‚Ä¶ &gt; Configure Build Path

2. In the Libraries Tab, under Classpath, click Add External JAR‚Ä¶

3. Navigate to the previously extracted JavaFX folder, go to the folder lib, and select every file in there and click Open.

Your Libraries should look like this.

Then, you need to modify Run Configurations.

This can be done by right-clicking Main.java &gt; Run As &gt; Run Configurations‚Ä¶ Under Arguments tab, in the VM arguments section, place this command in

For Windows

‚Äìmodule-path ‚ÄúPath to your JavaFX folderlib‚Äù ‚Äìadd-modules javafx.controls,javafx.graphics,javafx.media,javafx.fxml

For Mac

‚Äìmodule-path ‚ÄúPath to your JavaFX folderlib‚Äù ‚Äìadd-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

Afterwards, click Run and you will be able to run the program from now on.

2. Implementation Details:

There are six classes to be completed or be created if not exist: Main, ControlPane, ItemPane, ItemButton, FieldPane and FieldCell. There are already two classes provided: Item and SimulationManager. Your program can have more private methods/fields than specified in this instruction.

Tip: Use Ctrl+Space or auto-complete/suggestion feature will help you a lot. You can configure the key by going to Window -&gt; Preference -&gt; General -&gt; Keys and search for content assist.
